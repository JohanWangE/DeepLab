# DeepLab
2prime's Deep Learning  Lab(simple experiments and interesting observation)

www.2prime.cn

## Some useful tools going to update
- Data augmentation
- **MSRAinit:** *He K, Zhang X, Ren S, et al. Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification*, arxiv:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852

## Regression Test

> In this test, 2prime want's to discover the landscape of deep neural networks

This test is also a simple example to learn pytorch.

## ResNet Test
> Hope to discover the dynamic of ResNet
